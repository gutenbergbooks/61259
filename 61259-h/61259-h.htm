<h1 title="">The Telephone in America</h1>
<p><b>The telephone</b> was born in America and has reached its highest development
in this country. Since 1876, when Alexander Graham Bell first
talked successfully over his primitive telephone, a network of voice highways
has grown up throughout the nation, linking more than fifty-four million
telephones. About four-fifths of these are owned by the Bell System, which is
a group of closely associated telephone companies, a research and development
organization and a manufacturing and supply company, all headed
by the American Telephone and Telegraph Company. The other telephones
are owned and operated by some 5,000 independent telephone companies
and about 20,000 rural or farmer lines outside the Bell System but connecting
with it.</p>
<p>Bell telephone service is home town service. Linked with thousands of
other home town services, it makes a neighborhood of the nation. The company
that furnishes your service is part of your community. Its operators,
installers and other representatives are your neighbors. Some may be your
friends or relatives. Its departments are managed by your fellow citizens&mdash;men
and women who have come up through the ranks.</p>
<p>Nine out of every ten telephone calls handled by these home town
people are local calls. The tenth call may go across the continent or across
the ocean. But wherever the calls go, they travel by means of a marvelously
ordered world of wires, cables, switchboards, dial equipment, radio and
above all, with the help of people working together to serve the public.</p>
<p>This booklet gives you a personal glimpse of that world. It tells the
story of the Bell System, but it should be remembered that much that is said
here applies also to the other telephone companies that share with the Bell
System the privilege and the responsibility of providing telephone service
for the people of America.</p>

<p><b>When you pick up your telephone</b>, you have at your fingertips a
communication system that is mainly local in its operations. Probably you
will use it most of the time to talk to people in or near your own community,
but wherever you wish, it can carry your voice across the continent or even
across the seas to other countries. The telephone industry in the United
States now includes:</p>
<p>&#9632; Telephones serving homes and businesses in 75,000 cities and towns,
and more than 3,000,000 telephones in rural areas.</p>
<p>&#9632; A network of wire linking these telephones. About 95 per cent of this
wire is in sturdy cables, and almost three-fifths of the cable is underground.</p>
<p>&#9632; More than 25,000 central offices in which telephones are connected
by means of switching equipment. Over 9,500 of these offices are operated
by Bell System companies.</p>
<p>&#9632; Literally billions of small parts&mdash;relays, condensers, resistors, vacuum
tubes each carefully designed and finely fashioned so that it will work in
harmony with all other parts, anywhere in the country.</p>
<p>&#9632; Radio-telephone links to automobiles, trains, ships, airplanes, and
countries overseas.</p>
<p>&#9632; A growing system of radio relay routes used for transmitting both
long distance telephone conversations and television programs.</p>
<p>&#9632; Highly skilled telephone people living and working in nearly every
American community. The Bell System alone employs about 700,000 men

<h3 id="c2">In the telephone office</h3>
<p>Every time you make a telephone call&mdash;either by dialing or by giving
the operator the number&mdash;you first reach the <i>telephone central office</i>. This
nerve center of your local telephone system contains equipment through
which your telephone can be connected to any other telephone you wish
to reach.</p>
<p>In a small community there may be only one central office. In large
cities there are many of them, all joined by trunk lines. The term <i>telephone
exchange</i> means the whole local area served by one or more central offices.</p>
<p>Over four-fifths of all Bell System telephones are dial-operated. Intricate
machinery in the central office makes connections by obeying the
electrical signals that you send over your line as you turn the dial on your
telephone.</p>
<p>Before you dial, the equipment in the central office tells you it is ready
to serve you by transmitting a &ldquo;hum-m-m-m&rdquo; over your line. You should
hear this <i>dial tone</i> before you start to dial. The dial tone serves the same
purpose as the operator&rsquo;s &ldquo;Number, please!&rdquo;</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_5">5</div>
<p>Telephones that are not dial-operated are connected with <i>manual</i> central
offices, where operators seated at switchboards make the connections by
hand. Switchboards differ greatly in size. In small villages one or two
operators handle all calls. In large cities the volume of calls requires hundreds
of operators working at large multiple switchboards. The term
<i>multiple</i> comes from the fact that the end of each subscriber&rsquo;s telephone line
is duplicated or multipled at intervals throughout the switchboard. For
example, a switchboard serving 6,000 customers might have positions for 20
operators. The board would be multipled so that each operator answering
a call from any of the group of customers assigned to her, could reach his
line and connect it with any one of the 5,999 others.</p>
<p>Written as well as spoken messages are handled through switchboards.
Teletypewriter Exchange Service (TWX) does for the written word what
the telephone does for the spoken word. This service transmits typewritten
messages over any distance through connections made by operators at
switchboards. It is especially valuable for business firms; there are now
some 37,000 listings in the TWX directory.</p>

<p>The courteous, helpful service rendered by telephone operators has
become a traditional part of American life. Even in communities that have
dial service, &ldquo;the voice with a smile&rdquo; is on the job to handle long distance
calls, to provide telephone numbers not included in the directory, and to
give any other help that customers may desire.</p>
<p>Ever since World War II, the Bell companies have kept on installing
new equipment in great quantities to meet the largest demand ever experienced
for new telephone service.</p>
<h3 id="c3">Where the wires go</h3>
<p>The arrangement of wires that connects your telephone with the central
office and with the telephones of other subscribers is something like a tree.
Just as twigs lead to branches, branches to limbs, and limbs to the trunk,
so individual telephone wires come together in small <i>distribution cables</i>.
In turn, these cables come together in <i>feeder cables</i> that increase in size as
they approach the central office. Often as many as 2,121 pairs of fine copper
wires enter the telephone office in main feeder cables about as big around
as a baseball bat.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig8">

<p class="pcap"><i>Bell telephone installer connects drop wire to new subscriber&rsquo;s home.</i></p>
</div>
<p>Most wire in city telephone cables lies underground in tile conduits and
comes into the telephone office through a <i>cable vault</i> in the basement. If the
<span class="pb" id="Page_7">7</span>
city has more than one central office, <i>trunk cables</i> interconnect the offices.</p>
<p>At each telephone office the cables run to the <i>terminal room</i>, where their
hundreds or thousands of pairs of wires fan out to <i>terminal blocks</i> on one
side of a large <i>distributing frame</i>. Other wires run from the opposite side of
the distributing frame to the switchboard or dial equipment. Cross-connections
on the distributing frame bring each telephone user&rsquo;s line to its proper
terminal in the switching equipment.</p>
<p>A telephone office is dependent on electric power, both direct and alternating.
The direct current comes from storage batteries. These are kept
charged by generators driven by the regular current supplied by the power
company, which also provides the electricity needed for other purposes.
Standby generators, usually driven by gasoline or diesel engines, are provided
for emergencies in most large offices and in many smaller ones.</p>
<p>Ringing machines generate alternating current to operate your telephone
bell and provide the various signals you hear in your telephone
receiver. These machines are installed in pairs so that there will be no interruption
of telephone service should one machine fail to operate properly.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig10">

<p class="pcap"><i>Technicians check for trouble at a desk in a central office. Preventive maintenance,
outside as well as inside telephone offices, helps provide good service.</i></p>
</div>
<p>Preventive maintenance, both inside and outside telephone offices, is
vital in furnishing dependable, satisfactory telephone service. Telephone
men periodically check the condition of telephone plant. Using steadily
<span class="pb" id="Page_8">8</span>
improving techniques, they often discover faults or weaknesses and have
them corrected before the customer is aware of them.</p>
<p>Test desks, where testmen also track down troubles in the telephone
plant, are essential to giving good service. These are special switchboards
with equipment that enables the testman to diagnose the cause and location
of trouble on a customer&rsquo;s line.</p>
<h3 id="c4">Teamwork to serve you well</h3>
<p>In addition to good equipment kept in good condition all the time, good
telephone service depends on capable people who are well trained and skilled
in their jobs.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig11">
<img src="images/p06.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="427" />
<p class="pcap"><i>Telephone people strive to make the

<p>Not only must these many people perform many different jobs to give

department, linemen, installers, cable splicers, repairmen and others build
and maintain the plant so that the operators in the Traffic department can
<span class="pb" id="Page_9">9</span>

<p class="pcap"><i>Good telephone service depends on teamwork of many people working

</div>
<p>In every Bell telephone company there are staff people who are specialists
in various phases of the business. They assist the front-line forces
in meeting day-to-day problems. They find better, more efficient ways of
doing things.</p>
<p>The purpose of all is to serve you well and with unfailing courtesy.
Telephone people have a genuine desire to make the company a friendly
and helpful institution. Because telephone men and women are good citizens
of your community, they take pride in conducting the affairs of the company
so that the public will think of it, too, as a good citizen.</p>
<p>A large proportion of the people in the Bell System make a career of
telephone work. More than 245,000 of them have been in the business over
ten years. Wages are good, employment steady, and working conditions
are pleasant. The Bell companies&rsquo; Benefit and Pension Plans, among the
oldest and best in industry, assist employees and their families in meeting
the problems that arise from sickness, accident, old age and death. Opportunity
to advance in the organization is open to all on the basis of individual
ability. Supervisory and management positions are filled from the ranks.</p>

<p><b>As a telephone user</b>, you want to be able to count on your telephone,
to be able to call other telephone users any time, anywhere. You expect
reliable service at low cost. The kind of service you expect depends on
teamwork&mdash;among telephone people in your local company, and among
the separate companies that make up the Bell System. That is the way the
Bell System is organized to serve you. This is what it contains:</p>
<p>&#9632; A group of operating telephone companies, each known as an Associated
Company and each serving its particular territory.</p>
<p>&#9632; One of the finest research and development organizations in the
world, Bell Telephone Laboratories. Its work consists of research, development
and design in the communications field. It creates apparatus that
improves telephone service, makes it more efficient, and keeps its cost low.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">11</div>

themselves. It distributes equipment and supplies to the various companies.
It installs equipment in telephone central offices.</p>
<p>&#9632; A headquarters organization, the American Telephone and Telegraph
Company. AT&amp;T functions as a general staff for the Bell System,
co-ordinating the enterprise and assisting the operating companies. It
owns most of the stock of most of the operating companies. It owns nearly
all the stock of the Western Electric Company, and it shares with Western
Electric the ownership of the Bell Laboratories. In conjunction with the
Associated Companies, the AT&amp;T Long Lines Department furnishes long
<span class="pb" id="Page_12">12</span>
distance telephone service and other communication services over its lines
and radio relay channels.</p>

</div>
<p>The organization of the Bell System has grown up in a natural way
over a period of many years. The American Bell Telephone Company,
predecessor of AT&amp;T, owned the original Bell patents. It licensed local
companies to rent Bell telephones to their subscribers. Ownership of the
operating companies by the headquarters organization came about because
of their need to finance expanding service, and as a means of providing
the best service at lowest cost. AT&amp;T bought Western Electric in 1882
because it was the best manufacturer of telephone apparatus and because
a dependable source of supplies was essential. The Bell Laboratories
stemmed from the shop where Alexander Graham Bell made the first telephone.
The work of the Laboratories is a continuation, on a much larger
scale, of early efforts to discover improvements in the art of telephony.</p>

</div>
<h3 id="c6">Long Lines&mdash;When you call across the land</h3>
<p>Within its own territory your local telephone company provides inter-city
service. But when you make a call that crosses the territories of various
Bell companies, you are served also by the facilities of the Long Lines
Department. This organization is responsible as well for overseas telephone
service to points in countries abroad.</p>
<p>More than 337,000,000 conversations a year are handled over Long
Lines facilities. To handle this volume of conversations and its various
other services, Long Lines requires:</p>
<p>&#9632; About 27,000 highly trained telephone employees, including operators, engineers, maintenance men, construction forces, Commercial and Accounting people in 40 states and the District of Columbia.</p>
<p>&#9632; Telephone central office forces in 233 cities and towns.</p>
<p>&#9632; Telephone equipment and plant, including almost 2,400 buildings, in all but one state.</p>
<p>&#9632; About 27,000,000 miles of talking circuits.</p>
<p>Nine years after the telephone was invented, when the farthest one
<span class="pb" id="Page_14">14</span>
could talk was from New York to Boston, AT&amp;T announced in its charter
its plan to connect every place in the country &ldquo;by cable and other appropriate
means with the rest of the world.&rdquo; Long distance lines reached
Chicago in 1892. Gradually, telephone scientists solved the technical difficulties
of transmitting speech over still greater distances. By 1915, Bell
engineers had developed vacuum tube amplifiers to step-up fading voice
currents, and the human voice spanned the miles between New York and
San Francisco.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig16">

</div>
<h3 id="c7">When you call across the sea</h3>
<p>In that same year, telephone engineers also made history by establishing
experimental radio-telephone connections across the Atlantic between
Arlington, Va., near Washington. D. C., to the Eiffel Tower in Paris, as
well as to the Hawaiian Islands and Panama.</p>
<p>Although World War I delayed the development of overseas service,
years of further experimenting and perfecting led, in 1927, to the opening of
regular overseas telephone service between the United States and England.
Since then service has been extended to more than 100 countries and territories
overseas, and it is possible now to reach some 96% of the world&rsquo;s
telephones from any telephone in the United States. Today, overseas
conversations take place at the rate of over 1,000,000 a year. Overseas centers
in New York, Oakland and Miami furnish the overseas radiotelephone
service, handling calls in much the same way as other long distance calls.</p>

</div>
<p>Now, to handle more calls and for greater dependability in telephoning
between this continent and Great Britain, the first transatlantic cable is being
built. Another cable is being built to Alaska, which will be able to carry 36
conversations at a time, and will be immune to atmospheric disturbances
that sometimes affect radiotelephone circuits. There is also a new method
of radio transmission, called &ldquo;over-the-horizon,&rdquo; soon to be introduced
between Florida and Cuba. This will provide needed additional telephone
channels and will also open up the possibility of television service over the
route.</p>
<h3 id="c8">Radio and television networks</h3>
<p>Not everybody realizes that network radio programs go over telephone
channels from point of origin to the local radio stations that actually
broadcast them. The Bell System&rsquo;s experience in serving radio networks
dates from 1923, when network broadcasting began. Today, in order to
link the nation&rsquo;s radio stations, Long Lines operates about 200,000 miles
of program transmission circuits. And within their own territories, the
operating telephone companies, too, furnish some program circuits.</p>
<p>Bell System scientists pioneered also in sending television images
from one place to another, by both wire and radio. The years of experience
in serving radio networks have been invaluable in solving the problems
of TV network transmission. As of July, 1955, the System linked about
365 TV stations in about 240 American cities. To keep pace with the latest
developments, the nationwide TV network has been equipped for color
programs, which are available to over 230 stations in about 130 cities.</p>

<h3 id="c9">Other &ldquo;Custom-tailored&rdquo; services</h3>
<p>Long Lines and the operating companies also provide extensive private
line services&mdash;that is, service for customers who have a large enough volume
of communications between two or more points to need facilities for their
exclusive use, tailored to their individual requirements. The private line
services are provided by means of both wire and radio, for a specified period
of time and usually on a recurring basis. Many American industries, the
press and governmental agencies use these services, which include telephone,
teletypewriter, teletypesetter, radio and television network transmission,
facsimile and telephotograph.</p>
<p><i>Teletypewriter</i> service transmits typewritten messages from one point
to another, whether the sending and receiving machines are in the same
building or across the continent. <i>Teletypesetter</i> service, by means of electrical
impulses sent over Bell System circuits, makes it possible to set
type for newspaper or other publication use speedily and from a distance.
<i>Facsimile</i> service reproduces documents, drawings and maps at the distant
end and <i>telephotograph</i> service does the same for pictures.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">17</div>
<h3 id="c10">&ldquo;General Staff&rdquo; services benefit all</h3>
<p>Serving the local communities in their territories is the responsibility
of the operating companies. There are, however, general problems shared
by all the companies. In order to handle these problems efficiently and at
reasonable cost, the operating companies contract with the AT&amp;T Company
for those things that a centralized organization can do better and more
economically.</p>
<p>This contractual relationship is an outgrowth of the original licensing
arrangement, in which the first telephone companies obtained instruments
for the use of their subscribers. It was founded on the necessities of the
business. It exists today for the same reason.</p>
<p>To meet this responsibility, AT&amp;T is organized to serve the operating
companies in matters of engineering and operation, finance, accounting
and law, and to assist them in other ways that may help them in conducting
their business.</p>
<p>Through AT&amp;T, patent rights covering the results of Bell System
research in communications are made available to the operating companies.
It is the System&rsquo;s policy also to make licenses under such patents available to
others outside the System on reasonable terms and on a non-exclusive basis.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig19">

<p class="pcap"><i>Placed in service by Long Lines, this teletypewriter system is the &ldquo;nerve

</div>
<p>Among the many AT&amp;T staff services to the telephone companies are
those described as &ldquo;operation and engineering.&rdquo; These include the entire
range of construction, operation, maintenance, methods and practices. The
<span class="pb" id="Page_18">18</span>
AT&amp;T general staff constantly studies new ideas for improved equipment
and practices that may originate anywhere in the System. Promising ideas
are developed and tested, usually in collaboration with the Bell Telephone
Laboratories. Improvements that result are spread over the whole Bell
System.</p>
<p>Besides operation and engineering services, other AT&amp;T groups help
the telephone companies devise better business and office routines. Still
other groups advise the companies on the most efficient methods in accounting,
statistical analyses, public relations and advertising activities, and in
all the many other phases of the telephone business.</p>
<h3 id="c11">Out of the savings of the many</h3>
<p>One of AT&amp;T&rsquo;s most important services to the operating telephone
companies is financial assistance. This is especially true in periods of
rapid growth, like the present. In these times the telephone companies need
vast sums of money for equipment and buildings to expand and strengthen
the nation&rsquo;s communications network for defense, and to meet the public
demand for telephone service.</p>
<p>The money for improving and expanding telephone service comes from
people in all walks of life. It comes from the savings of the many, not the
wealth of the few. Most of this money is invested in securities of the AT&amp;T
Company, which in turn supplies funds to the operating companies.</p>
<p>By mid-1955 AT&amp;T was owned by about 1,375,000 people. These
owners live in all parts of the country, in large cities, small towns and
rural areas. They are truly a cross-section of America.</p>
<p>Many AT&amp;T share owners are long-time investors. More than a fourth
of them have owned their AT&amp;T stock ten years or more. And over 60
per cent of these have increased their investment during those ten years.</p>
<p>About 351,000 of the shareholdings represent two persons&mdash;husbands
and wives, mothers and daughters, sisters and brothers&mdash;who have invested
savings in their joint names.</p>
<p>Besides the direct owners of AT&amp;T, many other people&mdash;such as insurance
company policy holders and bank customers&mdash;help indirectly to finance
the business through the AT&amp;T shares held by organizations and trustees.
The largest AT&amp;T shareholder is a nation-wide investment firm that holds
stock for thousands of customers. Among other institutional holders are
some 2,100 churches, 1,100 hospitals and homes, over 1,000 schools and
libraries, over 500 foundations and charities.</p>

are now buying shares under the current payroll sayings plan.</p>
<p>Such widespread ownership by investors helps make possible the good
telephone service you get today.</p>
<h3 id="c12">Ideals and aims</h3>
<p>The management of the Bell System recognizes its responsibility to
treat fairly <i>telephone users</i>, <i>employees</i> and <i>share owners</i>. It believes that the
interests of these three great groups of people are linked closely together.</p>
<p>Management&rsquo;s aim and responsibility is to see that telephone users get
the most and best possible service. The cost of service must be as low as may
be consistent with good wages and working conditions for employees and
with a reasonable return for share owners on their investment in the business.</p>
<p>The Bell System believes that the <i>most and best possible service</i> means
telephone service for the nation that, so far as possible, is free from imperfections,
errors or delays&mdash;service that enables anyone, anywhere, to pick
up a telephone and talk to anyone else, clearly, quickly, at reasonable cost.</p>

<h2 id="c13"><span class="small">Research Improves Telephone Service</span></h2>
<p><b>Telephone research began in 1876</b> in the Boston attic where
Alexander Graham Bell carried on his first successful experiments on the
&ldquo;electric speaking telephone.&rdquo; From Bell&rsquo;s modest beginning has evolved
the Bell Telephone Laboratories of today, where over 9,000 scientists, engineers,
technicians and auxiliary personnel constantly seek ways to improve
telephone service, widen its usefulness, and keep its cost low.</p>
<p>Some members of the Laboratories are engaged in <i>basic research</i>. They
explore the physical sciences&mdash;physics, mathematics, chemistry&mdash;seeking
basic knowledge that may contribute to better communications. <i>Fundamental
development</i> is the second step in the chain leading toward manufacture
and use. In the third step, groups engaged in <i>systems engineering</i>
plan how the new knowledge and discoveries of research can be used to
create new facilities for telephone service, improve service, or reduce costs.
Final step is the specific <i>development</i> and <i>design</i> of new systems or
products. This involves the construction of laboratory models, trial models,
service tests, and preparations for mass production.</p>
<p>This description is, of course, a highly simplified account of the work
of the Laboratories. The broad functions of research and development constantly
merge. At all times there must be close co-operation among various
groups in the Laboratories, between the Laboratories and the telephone
companies, where models are tried out, and between the Laboratories and
Western Electric, where products are manufactured.</p>
<p>Here is just one example of the way research and development have
extended telephony, improved it, and reduced its cost:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">21</div>
<p>Many years ago, the use of a pair of wires instead of a single, grounded
wire greatly improved transmission and made it possible to talk longer
distances. This increased the demand for service but also increased the
number of wires strung on telephone poles. The large number of wires on
towering poles along city streets began to cast shadows of doubt on the
prospects for further growth. Compact cables had to be developed and a
way found to run them underground. Years of painstaking study and trial
accomplished this. Now some exchange cables contain as many as 2,121
pairs of wire.</p>
<p>This cable evolution illustrates the dollar value of telephone research
and development. The standard cable of 1888 contained 50 pairs of wires
and its installed cost was more than $150 per pair-mile. In 1954, despite
rising costs, underground cable cost in the order of $20 per pair-mile in
place, and much of it was 2,121-pair.</p>
<h3 id="c14">A few milestones in research</h3>
<p>Through the years Bell Laboratories has led progress in communications
and electronics. No scientific achievement has had more far-reaching
effects on communications than the Laboratories&rsquo; work in the development
of the vacuum tube. Bell scientists were the first to devise a practical amplifier
tube which, placed at intervals in long distance lines, restored the
energy of weakening voice currents, making it possible to telephone from
coast to coast.</p>
<p>The Laboratories was the first to develop automatic equipment that
can &ldquo;remember&rdquo; telephone numbers and perform other complicated operations
in the central office.</p>
<p>By means of filtering apparatus, developed by the Laboratories, one
high frequency &ldquo;carrier&rdquo; can carry many speech currents at the same time.
Largely because of carrier telephony, the Bell System has been able to
reduce greatly the cost of long distance telephone service.</p>
<p>The Laboratories pioneered the development of coaxial cable and
microwave radio-relay systems. Both can be used to transmit television
programs and hundreds of telephone conversations.</p>
<p>Among the many other achievements of the Laboratories have been
important contributions to the design of computers&mdash;the amazing electronic
machines that can work out problems that might otherwise take months or
years of work by mathematicians.</p>
<p>A few years ago, scientists at the Laboratories invented the <i>transistor</i>.
<span class="pb" id="Page_22">22</span>
This is a radically new device, simple in design and tiny in size, that performs
most of the functions of the vacuum tube and does other things besides.
Its effect on communications technology promises to be revolutionary.</p>
<p>Early in 1954, the Laboratories announced a device that realizes one
of the ancient dreams of mankind&mdash;the Bell Solar Battery, which converts
the sun&rsquo;s light directly into useful amounts of electricity. Research that led
to the transistor led also to the battery&mdash;and to a tiny and durable switch
that one day may handle the automatic switching of your telephone calls,
and other things not yet imagined.</p>
<h3 id="c15">The Laboratories and national defense</h3>
<p>The Laboratories makes its services available to the armed forces for
work to which it is uniquely suited. It specializes in military communications
and those instruments of war that depend heavily on communications
and electronics.</p>
<p>In carrying out its military responsibilities, the Laboratories follows
the same time-tested pattern that guides its Bell System activities. Its
military work grows out of <i>research</i>, <i>fundamental development</i>, <i>systems
engineering</i>, and finally specific <i>development</i> and <i>design</i>.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig22">

<p class="pcap"><i>Bell Telephone Laboratories at Murray Hill, New Jersey</i></p>
</div>
<p>Reliability and trouble-free operation throughout long life are objectives
of the Laboratories in designing new equipment and products for the
<span class="pb" id="Page_23">23</span>
Bell System. The same objectives are also
very important in designing military equipment.
Because of this similarity in the two
fields, scientists and engineers in the Laboratories
often divide their working days between
Bell System and military problems.
Personnel moves frequently between the two
fields of endeavor. Thus the Laboratories&rsquo;
long experience in the peacetime science of
telephony helps strengthen the nation&rsquo;s defense&mdash;and
discoveries that grow out of
military preparedness help strengthen and
improve the nations telephone system.</p>

<h2 id="c16"><span class="small">Service of Manufacture and Supply</span></h2>
<p><b>The manufacture of reliable</b>, standardized telephone apparatus
is a major responsibility of another Bell System unit, the Western Electric
Company. It supplies to the operating companies telephone equipment of
high quality at reasonable prices.</p>
<p>Western Electric also buys for the operating telephone companies supplies
that it does not itself produce. Since large quantities are required,
this arrangement results in important economies.</p>
<p>Western Electric speeds delivery to the telephone companies of the
right equipment and materials, and the right time, from stocks maintained
in distributing houses from coast to coast.</p>
<p>Also, specially trained western Electric forces install for the Bell
companies most of the complicated central office equipment required to
connect all parts of the telephone system.</p>
<p>Experience has proved the great value of centering these responsibilities
in an organization that works as a unit of the System toward the
same goals as the telephone companies&mdash;a service steadily improving and
increasing in value to more and more people.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_25">25</div>
<h3 id="c17">Evolution of an Industry</h3>
<p>In the first few years after the telephone was invented, six different
manufacturers made telephone apparatus for the Bell companies. Each
produced equipment of different design and quality. It quickly became
apparent that progress depended upon standardized equipment of the best
possible quality.</p>
<p>In 1882, the Bell System purchased the Western Electric Manufacturing
Company. This company had grown out of a partnership formed in
1869 by Enos M. Barton and Elisha Gray. It had specialized at first in
telegraph and then in telephone equipment. Ownership of Western Electric
gave the System assurance of standardized equipment of high quality, reasonable
prices, and a dependable source of supply.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig26">

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">26</div>
<p>Growing with the System, Western Electric became an enterprise of
national stature. Its manufacturing operations are principally in Chicago,
Ill., Kearny, N. J., Baltimore, Md., Allentown, Pa., Tonawanda, N. Y.,
Indianapolis, Ind., and Winston-Salem, N. C.</p>
<p>In the years since World War II the company&rsquo;s manufacturing facilities
have undergone an almost continuous modernization and expansion.
In addition to building a number of new factories, the company has rented
or purchased other plants to obtain the manufacturing space required for
the dual job of furnishing equipment needed by the armed forces and
continuing to meet the requirements of the Bell System.</p>
<h3 id="c18">A complex manufacturing job</h3>
<p>As manufacturing unit of the Bell System, Western Electric must be
ready at all times to produce over 200,000 different kinds of apparatus
and component parts for telephone equipment. Each year, about 70,000 of
these are required and manufactured. The quantity of each item produced
varies from one to many millions. Mass production methods are used
wherever possible, but the items required in large quantities are very much
in the minority. In a recent year, less than one per cent of the products
manufactured were made in quantities of over 100,000. About 30 per cent
were made in quantities of less than 10.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">27</div>
<p>Because telephone equipment must be tailor-made&mdash;much of it in small
quantities&mdash;it is necessary for the manufacturing and supply unit to have
intimate knowledge of Bell System plant everywhere. And since telephone
plant must give trouble-free service 24 hours a day, telephone equipment
must be of the highest quality and built to exact, uniform standards. Experience
has proved that the design, manufacture and operation of standard
telephone equipment can be accomplished best when the designers, the
makers, and the operating people work closely together on the same team.</p>
<h3 id="c19">Supplies&mdash;when and where needed</h3>
<p>Western Electric&rsquo;s purchasing people constantly study world markets,
prices and potential sources of raw materials and finished products. They
work closely with suppliers that provide equipment and supplies that
Western itself does not make, so that these will meet the Bell System&rsquo;s high
standards. Western also helps them develop better production methods.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig30">
<img src="images/p15c.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="193" />
<p class="pcap"><i>A fingertip view of a &ldquo;2A&rdquo; transistor, one model of the astonishing electronic device

</div>
<p>In a recent year Western Electric purchased from 28,000 large and
small suppliers located in over 3,000 towns and cities in all the 48 states.
Purchases included, in addition to all kinds of raw materials, finished
products ranging from pencils and pen points to automobiles and telephone
poles.</p>
<p>Western Electric operates 29 distributing houses through which materials
flow to the Bell companies. Each house is set up to meet the supplies
requirements of the telephone company it serves. It works closely with the
telephone organization to deliver the goods promptly and efficiently. Each
<span class="pb" id="Page_28">28</span>
distributing house maintains a repair shop to recondition service-worn
telephone apparatus so that it will give good service again, or, if not economical
to repair, to dismantle it for salvage. In a recent year the repair
shops reconditioned over $155,000,000 worth of used equipment for the
telephone companies, including 5,400,000 telephones.</p>
<p>Highly trained Western Electric men install central office equipment
for the Bell telephone companies. Altogether, Western Electric is able to
supervise all steps in making the equipment ready for use, from purchase
of raw materials to finished installation. This assures the telephone companies
that new apparatus will give the best possible service.</p>
<h3 id="c20">A national asset</h3>
<p>Time and again the unified service of supply within the Bell System
has proved to be a national asset. After hurricanes, floods and fires, when
telephone company people go &ldquo;all out&rdquo; to restore service, Western Electric
swings into action to deliver the needed equipment and supplies. And this
equipment is standardized. It is familiar to all telephone people and can
be installed quickly anywhere.</p>
<p>Western&rsquo;s productive capacity is ready also in any national defense
emergency. Throughout World War II all of the company&rsquo;s resources were
devoted to the needs of the United States and its allies for electronic and
communications equipment, including radar, sonar and various types of
radio equipment.</p>
<p>In the present national defense program, Western is not only helping
to expand and improve America&rsquo;s telephone system, but is using experience
gained in its regular telephone job to supply specialized military equipment
to the armed forces.</p>
<p>After World War II Western Electric produced record-breaking quantities
of equipment to meet America&rsquo;s telephone needs. It increased its production
tremendously to meet the big demand for telephones, willingly
undertaking the financial risks of a big expansion program so that the operating
companies could serve millions of people faster than otherwise possible.</p>
<p>Since the end of World War II, prices of manufactured goods of all
kinds have gone up, but Western Electric prices have gone up far less than
the average&mdash;as of the end of 1954, they had gone up less than half as much.</p>
<p>Because it works as a unit of the System rather than toward a separate
end of its own. Western Electric plays an essential part in furnishing Americans
with the best telephone service at the lowest possible cost.</p>

<h2 id="c21"><span class="small">From Bell to Bell System</span></h2>
<div class="img" id="fig31">
<img src="images/p16.jpg" alt="" width="428" height="399" />
<p class="pcap">This model of Bell&rsquo;s first telephone is a duplicate
of the instrument through which speech sounds were first transmitted electronically, 1875.</p>
</div>
<p><b>The telephone we use today</b> is very different in design from the
first instrument invented by Alexander Graham Bell, but it works on the
same principle. As soon as Bell proved his invention practical, he foresaw
it could link homes with offices, sweep aside the isolation of farms, and bind
together cities and nations with electrically transmitted speech.</p>
<p>Alexander Graham Bell had prepared himself to follow the professional
footsteps of his father and grandfather in the teaching of proper
articulation and the correction of speech defects. He became a teacher of
speech to the deaf. Early in his training, his investigations into the nature
of sound led him to study electricity. It was out of this work, together with
his understanding of the organs of speech and hearing, that his invention
grew.</p>
<p>He attempted to apply sound to telegraphy in a device called the harmonic
telegraph. He hoped it would transmit several Morse messages tuned
at differing levels over the same circuit simultaneously. While he was working
with this device, Bell conceived the principle of the telephone.</p>
<p>He told his young mechanical assistant, Thomas A. Watson: &ldquo;If I can
get a mechanism which will make a current of electricity vary in intensity
as the air varies in density when a sound is passing through it, I can
telegraph any sound, even the sound of speech.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="c22">The twang of a reed</h3>
<p>This idea was clear in Bell&rsquo;s mind by the summer of 1871, but he did
not then know how to reduce it to practice. On June 2, 1875, he succeeded
in doing so. In adjoining attic rooms at 109 Court Street, Boston, he and
Watson were trying out several pairs of harmonic telegraph instruments
<span class="pb" id="Page_30">30</span>
each consisting of an electromagnet with a steel organ reed vibrating over
it. One reed stuck. Watson plucked it with his finger to start it again, but
it did not come free, so Bell heard an unusual sound. Instead of hearing a
series of electric pulsations, he recognized the twang of a vibrating reed!
He knew then that, as Watson has put it, &ldquo;he was hearing, for the first time
in human history, the tones and overtones of a sound transmitted by electricity.&rdquo;
That afternoon Bell directed Watson to make the instrument that
was to be the first Bell telephone. This instrument transmitted voice tones,
but not until March 10, 1876, did Bell succeed in transmitting an intelligible
sentence of speech.</p>
<h3 id="c23">The telephone talks</h3>
<p>On the evening of that day, as the young inventor prepared a crude
experimental transmitter to try to send his voice over a wire to a room down
the hall where Watson was listening, he upset the acid of a battery. It spilled
over his clothes. Impulsively, Bell called out, &ldquo;Mr. Watson, come here: I
want you!&rdquo; An instant later Watson burst into the room shouting &ldquo;Mr.
Bell, I heard every word you said&mdash;distinctly!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bell exhibited and demonstrated his telephone at the Philadelphia
Centennial in June, 1876, where it won the enthusiastic approval of leaders
in the scientific world. But the general public showed little interest. The
young inventor had no financial backing other than that of Thomas Sanders
and Gardiner C. Hubbard. In the fall of 1871 these men had agreed to
supply funds for Bell&rsquo;s telegraph experiments in return for a share in whatever
patent rights might result from his experiments. His telephone patents
were later included in this agreement.</p>
<p>Bell&rsquo;s first telephone patent had been granted on March 7, 1876, but
was earning no return. Sanders and Hubbard had advanced all they could.
In order to eke out his small personal income as a teacher, and to provide
funds for further experimentation, Bell began, early in 1877, to give lectures
at which he demonstrated the telephone. These were well attended, and
accounts of them were widely published. A few forward-looking people
began to realize the usefulness of the telephone. In May, 1877, the first telephones
were put into use on a commercial basis. Soon people throughout the
country began to inquire about how to get into the telephone business.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">31</div>
<h3 id="c24">How the Bell System was formed</h3>
<p>The commercial development of the telephone had begun and the time
had come for a more definite organization than the rather informal arrangement
that had been made between Bell, Sanders and Hubbard, into which
Watson had by this time been admitted.</p>
<p>This took the form of a trusteeship, instituted in July, 1877, by these
four owners of the patents. Hubbard was trustee and virtual executive head
of the enterprise. It was he who introduced the policy of leasing instruments
instead of selling them and who introduced the system of licenses to authorized
agents or licensees throughout the country for the commercial development
of the telephone, laying the foundation for the Bell System of today.</p>
<p>Telephones first were leased in pairs. The lessee put up his own wire
to connect his telephone with that of a friend or neighbor, or ran the line
between his home and place of business. There was no way he could talk
by telephone with others in the community who leased instruments.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig32">
<img src="images/p17.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="327" />
<p class="pcap">&ldquo;<i>Mr. Bell, I heard
every word you
said&mdash;distinctly!</i>&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>The interconnection of these individual subscribers awaited the development
of the telephone switchboard. The first switchboard was installed
in the office of E. T. Holmes, in Boston, in May, 1877, and connected four
banks and a manufacturing concern. It connected these few telephones in
the daytime by wires that were used for a burglar alarm system at night.
New Haven, Conn., became the first city in the world to have a commercial
<span class="pb" id="Page_32">32</span>
telephone exchange. A switchboard connecting eight lines and 21 subscribers
went into service there in January, 1878.</p>
<p>Two years later in April, 1880, the American Bell Telephone Company
was organized. It greatly developed the telephone organization and business
throughout the country. A line from Boston to Providence was built
in 1881. Service between Boston and New York, 235 miles, opened in 1884.</p>
<p>An important step in the attainment of a nation-wide telephone service
was the organization of American Telephone and Telegraph Company in
1885. This company was formed to build and operate long distance lines to
interconnect the regional companies that had developed, by merger and
growth from early licensee companies.</p>
<p>To attain the ideal of universal telephone service, it became increasingly
important to extend the long distance lines even farther, to carry on
continuous investigation in the practical development of the telephone art,
to make further progress toward the standardization of apparatus, equipment
and methods and to handle economically and efficiently the many
general problems shared by the telephone companies. In 1900, therefore,
the American Telephone and Telegraph Company took over the assets of
the American Bell Telephone Company and became the headquarters company
of the Bell System.</p>

</div>
<p><b>Year after year</b>, the Bell System has provided service of steadily
increasing value to more and more people. Through times of boom and
depression, during all-out war and postwar readjustment, and now in a
period of defense preparation, the Bell companies have improved and
strengthened the communications network in order to do the best possible
job for the nation. Here are some of the accomplishments that have been
made in the period since 1920:</p>
<p>&#9632; Fast, accurate dial service has been extended to more than four-fifths
of all Bell System telephones.</p>
<p>&#9632; Sturdy cable lines, capable of carrying thousands of conversations,
now reach from border to border, and from coast to coast. These transcontinental
cable lines are invaluable for maintaining communications in case
of a national emergency.</p>
<p>&#9632; A microwave radio relay route, carrying both telephone conversations
and television programs, now spans the nation.</p>
<p>&#9632; The regional companies of the Bell System have enlarged their facilities
in order to take care of about 160,000,000 telephone conversations per
day&mdash;more than four times as many as in 1920.</p>
<p>&#9632; Drawing Americans closer together, long distance facilities have been
expanded in order to handle more than 2,600,000,000 intercity calls a year,
compared to about 270,000,000 in 1920.</p>
<p>&#9632; Radio-telephone provides regular service overseas, to ocean liners,
coastal and inland watercraft, motor vehicles, trains and airplanes.</p>

<h3 id="c26">Your telephone is more valuable</h3>
<p>Your telephone is a much better &ldquo;buy&rdquo; than ever before. Many more
people now have telephones, and local calling areas have been extended.
You can call more people and more can reach you.</p>
<p>These days, when the cost of nearly everything is higher than ever
before, the price of telephone service has remained relatively low. On the
average, since the Korean war, the cost of telephone service has gone up
much less than the cost of other things you buy.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig35">
<img src="images/p19a.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="179" />

<p>Over the years there has been a remarkable reduction in long distance
rates. Between 25 of the principal cities in the country, the average day
rate for station calls has dropped from $6 in 1920 to about $1.55 today.
The day rate for a New York-San Francisco station call has been reduced
from $16.50 to $2.50. Overseas rates have been cut drastically since the
service opened in 1927. A New York-London call that cost $75 in 1927
now costs only $12 in the daytime, or $9 nights and Sundays.</p>
<h3 id="c27">The goal&mdash;constantly improving service</h3>
<p>The Bell System strives constantly to improve service. New devices,
new systems, promise more and better telephone service at the lowest
possible cost.</p>
<p>Dial service is being extended, of course, to more and more communities.
Also, new equipment now enables operators to dial many long
distance calls straight through to distant telephones without the assistance of
other telephone operators along the route. Operator long distance dialing
networks now crisscross the country, reaching out to about 3,600 cities and
<span class="pb" id="Page_36">36</span>
localities. Other localities are constantly being joined to these networks.</p>
<p>In more than 40 towns special installations enable customers to dial
long distance calls directly to more than 11,000,000 telephones from coast
to coast. An &ldquo;electric brain&rdquo; receives a number as it is dialed and completes
the call. An automatic accounting system gathers the information for
billing. Bell telephone engineers plan the extension of this Direct Distance
Dialing to serve the whole nation in a decade or so.</p>
<p>Bell System mobile telephone service is now a reality in most major
cities and on many highways. &ldquo;Traveling telephones&rdquo; are numerous on
ships that ply coastal and inland waterways, and a growing number of
passenger trains now offer regular telephone service. In addition, private
line mobile telephone systems, leased and serviced by the various Bell telephone
companies, are being used increasingly by police departments,
utilities and industrial concerns.</p>
<p>With the help of fast, economical construction methods and new
transmission techniques, the Bell companies are improving and extending
telephone service in rural areas. Power-driven augers quickly drill pole
holes. Special plows place wire underground and cover it, in one operation.
By means of special equipment, both electric power and telephone conversations
can travel to farms over the same wires.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig36">

<p class="pcap"><i>Ambulance driver talks over mobile telephone.</i></p>
</div>
<p>These methods have helped telephone engineers and construction
forces put in rural telephone facilities three times faster than ever before.
Gradually, the telephone is eliminating the traditional isolation of farm
<span class="pb" id="Page_37">37</span>
life. Rural localities have been linked by literally tens of thousands of miles
of new pole lines, by modern central office buildings, by the most up-to-date
switchboards. Great strides are being made in improving the quality
of rural telephone service.</p>
<p>With the steady pressure of world tensions, the Bell System has taken
many steps to make sure that America&rsquo;s defense needs will be met. The
telephone companies have a good foundation to build on. Telephone buildings
are of unusually strong construction. The entire United States is
blanketed by a network of telephone circuits. American cities are underlaid
by networks of underground cables, which, as wartime experience in
Japan showed, would not generally be destroyed even by atom bombs.</p>
<p>The nation is now spanned&mdash;coast to coast, and north to south&mdash;by
&ldquo;backbone&rdquo; communication routes. Calls between cities can be routed over
many alternate paths, and destruction of telephone facilities at one point
would be like throwing a pebble through a huge spider web. While service
at the one point might be temporarily interrupted, the nation-wide communications
web would continue to function. Because of the strength and
flexibility of the telephone network, the basic means of communication in
the nation&rsquo;s Civil Defense setup has been built around the telephone.</p>
<p>Throughout America the work of improving and strengthening the
telephone system goes on. The goal is to help make the nation invulnerable
against attack, and to provide the public with the best possible service, at
reasonable cost, in rural communities, in cities, and on intercity routes.</p>

<p><b>Neither chance</b> nor mere good fortune has brought this nation the
finest telephone service in the world. Americans enjoy this service as a
result of their own enterprise and common sense.</p>
<p>The people of this nation have found more and more ways to use
the telephone in their daily lives. They have encouraged initiative and
invention. They have made the job of providing telephone service a public
trust. At the same time, they have given the telephone companies, under
regulation, the freedom and resources to do their job as well as possible.</p>
<p>In this climate of freedom and responsibility, the Bell telephone companies
have provided service of steadily increasing value. And the quality
of service has been steadily improved.</p>
<p>In the years since World War II, the public demand for service has
been so great that the Bell System has carried out the most extensive construction
program ever undertaken in so short a time by any single enterprise.
The people of America made this program possible. Since the war,
and through 1954, they have invested about seven billion dollars of their
savings in Bell System securities, and this money has been used to construct
new telephone buildings, buy new equipment, and extend service.</p>
<p>Now, some ten years after the war, the term &ldquo;extend service&rdquo; means
much more than being able to provide a telephone for those who want it.
Today, the telephone in America has gained many new dimensions as the
Bell System offers more and more things to meet the wants of the American
people&mdash;things that add even more variety and convenience to its service.
Telephones in attractive colors that blend or contrast with any decorative
scheme; telephones with illuminated dials that can be seen in the dark;
telephones with push buttons to answer as many as six lines; equipment
that will automatically answer calls when no one is in, and give and take
recorded messages&mdash;these are only a few of many.</p>
<p>Bell System men and women, with experience and skill, backed by the
great flexibility of their communications network, are writing the story of
steadily improving telephone service&mdash;a story that will have no ending.</p>
